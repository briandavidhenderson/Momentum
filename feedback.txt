Below is a distilled list of the main capabilities researchers say they need from modern lab‑management software and electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) to handle ordering, inventory, protocol creation and experiment execution end‑to‑end. Each item includes evidence from recent reviews and articles.

Automated inventory tracking and low‑stock alerts – Users expect the system to track supplies automatically, record how much is used and trigger warnings when items run low. Articles on lab‑inventory tools emphasise that automated low‑stock alerts and reorder points save time and prevent costly outages

. Real‑time updates and bar‑code scanning allow staff to monitor stock levels and usage trends

Integrated order management and supplier tracking – An end‑to‑end platform should let labs create purchase requests, monitor order status and manage vendors from the same interface. MaterialsZone’s overview notes that integrated supplier tracking and automated re‑ordering improve supply‑chain resilience

, while research shows combining lab‑management software with procurement tools can save managers several hours per week on ordering and supplier communication

Real‑time sample & material management – Built‑in modules should manage samples, reagents and equipment (e.g., virtual freezers). Sapio Sciences’ article states that comprehensive sample, material and inventory management features streamline tracking and storage, reduce errors and provide real‑time visibility into inventories

. Genemod highlights dynamic inventory management with virtual freezers and consumable management to simplify monitoring

.

Centralised data and unified platform – Scientists need one system where experiments, protocols, inventory and results reside together. Centralising data fosters real‑time collaboration, advanced analytics and seamless integration with external databases

. Users of SciNote praise having protocols, experiment setup, inventories and results “in one place and … accessible from anywhere”

.

Protocol and SOP management with version control – ELNs should allow users to create templates for standard operating procedures, import external protocols (e.g., from protocols.io) and maintain version history. SciNote’s feature set lets researchers create and share protocol templates and view different versions
scinote.net
, and it offers checklists for protocol steps during experiments

.

Experiment planning and workflow management – Modern lab software must support project‑level planning, experiment scheduling and task checklists. SciNote’s project/experiment/task structure lets users assign inventory items, add protocols and tick off steps as they are completed
scinote.net
. Such workflow tools help labs track progress and ensure experiments are executed consistently.

Real‑time collaboration and team communication – Because lab work is collaborative, tools should offer comment threads, tagging and notifications. MaterialsZone notes that role‑based access supports multi‑user collaboration

, while Genemod emphasises real‑time document editing and feedback during inventory management
genemod.net
. SciNote lets teams post comments, tag members and receive updates on project progress

.

Regulatory compliance, audit trails and security – Labs operate under strict regulations; software must provide electronic signatures, time‑stamped audit trails, role‑based access controls and encryption. SciNote highlights features that meet GLP/GMP and FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements, including audit logs and access controls
scinote.net
. Genemod adds that cloud‑based LIMS must offer strong security, data integrity checks and role‑based access controls to comply with HIPAA and GDPR

.

Integration with instruments and external systems – Users want to link ELNs with LIMS, instruments, ERP/procurement systems and databases. MaterialsZone lists integration with ELNs/LIMS/ERP among the key features
materials.zone
. Genemod notes that integrating order management systems, electronic lab notebooks and inventory management provides a thorough view of operations and better resource allocation
genemod.net
. Sapio describes centralised data that is easily integrated with external databases

.

Reporting & analytics tools – End‑to‑end lab platforms should generate experiment summaries, inventory usage reports and compliance documentation. MaterialsZone counts reporting and analytics among essential features
materials.zone
. SciNote offers a report generator that uploads results, records who performed each action and produces auto‑generated project reports
scinote.net
. These capabilities help labs analyse trends, optimise inventory levels and demonstrate compliance.

Together, these capabilities define what researchers expect from modern lab‑management software and ELNs: automated tracking, integrated ordering, robust sample management, centralised data, comprehensive protocol and experiment workflows, collaboration, compliance, integration and data analytics.
