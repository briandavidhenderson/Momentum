# Outdated and Deletable Files Report

## Criteria for Identification
- **Outdated files**: Files that are generated during builds, deployments, or runtime (e.g., logs, build output files) and are not required for source control or future builds.
- **Deletable files**: Files that appear to be leftovers, duplicates, or documentation not actively used (e.g., old notes, temporary text files, duplicate license files inside `node_modules`).

## Files Marked as Outdated (Can be safely removed)

| `build_log_utf8_2.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `build_log_utf8_3.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `build_log_utf8_4.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `build_output.txt` | Build output summary, can be regenerated. |
| `deploy_log.txt` | Deployment log from previous `npm run deploy:all`. |

| `migration_test_output_21.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `migration_test_output_3.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `migration_test_output_4.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `migration_test_output_5.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `migration_test_output_6.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `migration_test_output_7.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `migration_test_output_8.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `migration_test_output_9.txt` | Duplicate. |
| `hosting_log.txt` | Hosting log, can be regenerated. |
| `npm-debug.log` (if present) | npm debug log, not needed. |

## Files Marked as Deletable (Likely Unused or Redundant)
| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|

| `Things to Add.txt` | TODO list, can be moved to project management tool. |
| `README.md` (if outdated) | Verify if current README reflects project; otherwise update or remove. |
| `UI_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` | May be a one‑time analysis; keep only if still needed. |
| `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | Reference doc; keep only if team still uses it. |
| `EQUIPMENT_BOOKING_SYSTEM.md` | Documentation; verify relevance. |
| `HOME_PAGE_STRUCTURE.md` | May be outdated design doc; verify usage. |
| `ORCID_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Keep only if still needed for support. |
| `SETUP_FIREBASE_ENV.md` | Setup guide; keep if still relevant. |
| `SECRET_MANAGER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | Implementation doc; keep if still referenced. |
| `CODEBASE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` | May be outdated; verify. |
| `CODEOWNERS` | Keep only if repository uses it for code ownership. |
| `LICENSE.txt` files inside `node_modules` (e.g., `firebase/functions/node_modules/.../LICENSE.txt`) | These are part of dependencies and managed by package manager; can be ignored in repo cleanup. |
| `*.log` files inside `node_modules` directories | Generated by dependencies; not needed. |

## Recommendations
1. **Delete all files listed under *Outdated files*** – they are generated artifacts and can be safely removed to reduce repository size.
2. **Review *Deletable files* individually** – confirm they are not required for documentation or onboarding before removal.
3. **Add a `.gitignore` entry** for `*.log`, `*.txt` (if appropriate), and any other generated directories (e.g., `build_*`, `deploy_*`) to prevent future commits of these files.
4. **Run a linter/unused‑code analysis** (e.g., `ts-prune` or similar) to catch any additional dead code files not covered here.
