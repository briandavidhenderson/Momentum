1. Dr. Aoife Byrne – Principal Investigator (PI, Academic)

Role: PI of a translational oncology lab (10–12 people)

Chronotype: Morning lark (sharpest 7:00–11:00)

Style: Mostly Manager Schedule, but still writes grants and sometimes analyses data (hybrid).

What I need most

High-level visibility without micromanaging

Project timelines, key milestones, who’s blocked, who’s in an “Active / do not disturb” phase.

Trustable “lab heartbeat” dashboard

Which instruments are running, which protocols are mid-flight, what’s in incubators today.

Minimal-friction progress updates

Short async updates from students (e.g. 3 bullet points / day) instead of constant meetings.

Meeting clustering & “office hours”

A way to bundle student 1:1s into two predictable blocks per week.

Grant & compliance linkage

Being able to map experiments and tasks to grants, work packages, deliverables.

What I hate

Needing 5 clicks to see if the lab is actually doing anything

Overly granular tracking (“log every pipette stroke”) I will never read

Tools that make my students spend more time logging than doing experiments

Rigid workflows that assume QC factories, not messy R&D

Notification spam – I don’t need 30 emails saying “Task moved from Doing to Done”.

What will make me use it

I can open one dashboard and answer:

“Who is doing what, what’s at risk this week, and are we on track for this grant?”

My students start coming to meetings better prepared (fewer “uh… I did some stuff” updates).

Scheduling 1:1s feels like dragging coloured blocks into “Passive time” on their protocols, not negotiating via email for three days.

What will make me stop using it

If I perceive that it slows my lab down or adds admin for no clear gain.

If students treat it as a performance surveillance tool rather than a support tool and morale drops.

If I still have to keep my Excel “secret master sheet” because I don’t trust its data.

2. Dr. Mateo Rossi – Senior Postdoc / Project Lead

Role: Leads 2 major projects, supervises 2 PhDs, still on the bench

Chronotype: Mid-morning peak (10:00–14:00), brain-fried after 17:00

Style: 60% Maker, 40% Manager

What I need most

Protection for 3–4 hour deep experimental blocks

Hard boundaries around cell culture, surgeries, complex protocols.

Protocol-based scheduling

I pick “3D spheroid assay” template, it auto-maps Active vs Passive chunks onto my calendar.

Smart use of Passive time

During incubation, it surfaces tiny tasks: review student data, answer PI’s comments, write methods.

Cross-project view of my week

So I don’t accidentally schedule 3 “Active” phases across 2 projects in the same afternoon.

Quick handover view

“If I get COVID, what can someone else pick up tomorrow?”

What I hate

Tools that assume my day is a sequence of identical 30-min tasks

Being forced to micro-log every little adjustment to a protocol

Poor offline/bench usability (tiny fonts, 12 tabs, bad on iPad with gloves)

Having no way to mark ‘do not disturb – critical experiment’ so people still ping me constantly

Systems that break when experiments slip (e.g., unexpected overnight incubations)

What will make me use it

It automatically suggests good meeting slots during my passive phases.

It reduces the number of status meetings because my PI can see progress without calling me.

It works as a bench-first UI: big text, 3–4 actions, tick off steps with a thumb while holding a pipette.

What will make me stop using it

If it double-books me (two active experiments at once).

If it does not gracefully handle slippage (PCR fails, incubation extended, etc.).

If it becomes “yet another place” I have to update manually on top of my notebook and Slack.

3. Priya Nair – PhD Student (Wet-Lab Heavy, Night Owl)

Role: 2nd-year PhD, runs most of the wet experiments

Chronotype: Night owl (best 14:00–22:00)

Style: Almost pure Maker Schedule

What I need most

Long uninterrupted blocks

Ability to mark 13:00–17:00 as “critical bench work – no meetings”.

Experiment planner tied to reality

I drop in 3 experiments for the week and it auto-creates a timeline of active/passive phases.

Help managing overlapping timers

Clear view: “20 min left on spin, 40 min left on incubation, 10 min till you must move the gel.”

Simple, fast experiment logging

Tap to attach photo of gel, note key deviations, done.

Clarity on expectations

A way to align with PI on what “done this week” looks like without constant ad-hoc check-ins.

What I hate

Systems that feel like surveillance

Time tracking to the minute, screenshots, creepy analytics.

Being forced into 9–5 scheduling when my brain only wakes up at 11:00.

Overloaded dashboards – 50 widgets, no idea where to click to just “plan Tuesday’s experiments”.

Tools that don’t talk to my calendar / email (more copy-paste).

Being asked to log the same experiment in three places (ELN, Excel, and new app).

What will make me use it

It helps me defend deep work time and gives me language to say:

“I’m in an Active block, I’ll be fully available at 15:30.”

It makes my weekly PI meeting easier: I can show a timeline of what I ran, not scramble through notebooks.

It reduces anxiety by visually untangling my week into a sensible sequence of experiments.

What will make me stop using it

If I feel it’s mainly for the PI’s benefit and adds pain to my day.

If using it means I lose my preferred working rhythm (no late-afternoon focus anymore).

If it frequently breaks on mobile or logs me out mid-bench.

4. Sarah O’Connell – Lab Manager / Safety Officer

Role: Orders reagents, maintains equipment, enforces safety & training

Chronotype: Morning-biased, mentally tired by mid-afternoon

Style: Hybrid Manager, but with lots of physical tasks

What I need most

Centralized equipment booking and health status

Which instruments are booked, down for maintenance, or overdue for calibration.

Inventory with burn-rate awareness

Automated alerts: “Based on bookings, you’ll run out of X buffer in 2 weeks.”

Training & permission tracking

Who is allowed to use which equipment; block bookings if training is missing.

Incident & deviation logging

Quick way for staff to report “centrifuge making weird noise” or “spill in hood #3.”

Alignment with protocols

See which unit operations are driving demand (e.g., tons of Western blots → more PVDF, more antibodies).

What I hate

People booking equipment ‘just in case’ and never showing up (ghost bookings).

Static calendars that don’t adjust when experiments run long – causing cascade clashes.

Systems that don’t support bulk updates (e.g., updating lot numbers across multiple protocols).

No link between booking and consumables – equipment booked but no reagents in stock.

Overly technical dashboards that PIs like but day-to-day staff can’t stand using.

What will make me use it

It automatically releases no-show bookings and suggests optimal reallocation.

It gives me a “today’s risks” snapshot: low stock, overdue maintenance, high-contamination-risk workflows.

People actually follow the booking rules because the system makes it easy and fair.

What will make me stop using it

If I end up manually cleaning the data all the time (fixing other people’s sloppy entries).

If people can bypass the system easily (post-it notes on machines instead).

If it becomes a second inventory to maintain alongside the “real” one in Excel or ERP.

5. James Liu – QC Scientist (Biotech, Regulated Lab)

Role: Runs validated assays in GMP-like environment

Chronotype: Intermediate, good 9:00–17:00

Style: Structured Maker, but with more repetition

What I need most

Protocol templates with version control & e-signatures

SOP-driven workflows that are easy to follow and fully auditable.

Error-proofing & guardrails

Hard stops if I miss critical checks; prompts to record lot numbers, expiry dates, control results.

Clean integration with LIMS / ELN

So I’m not doing duplicate data entry.

Robust deviation & CAPA tracking

Link failed runs to root cause, retraining, corrective actions.

Shift-friendly scheduling

Clear handovers between morning and evening shifts.

What I hate

Systems that are “cute” but not compliant (no audit trail, no 21 CFR Part 11 thinking).

UIs that bury critical QC steps behind nested menus.

Inconsistent data fields – today “Lot No.”, tomorrow “BatchID” – reporting becomes hell.

Tools that break when internet flickers, losing half an assay’s documentation.

Over-flexible “freestyle” features that let people stray from SOPs.

What will make me use it

It reduces documentation time without compromising compliance.

Audits go smoother because everything is traceable and readable in one place.

It’s stable and clearly designed with regulated workflows in mind.

What will make me stop using it

If we still have to print and sign paper because it doesn’t meet compliance standards.

If updates are frequent and change UI flow in subtle ways that risk mistakes.

If it’s obviously designed for “creative R&D labs only” and not our reality.

6. Dr. Lena Kovacs – Computational Biologist / Data Scientist

Role: Mostly at a desk, but deeply tied to lab output

Chronotype: Late afternoon/evening powerhouse

Style: Pure Maker, but digital

What I need most

Protected 2–3 hour deep focus windows for analysis

Clear linkage between experiments and data

Which sequencing run belongs to which protocol, sample, and hypothesis.

Asynchronous collaboration features

Comment threads on datasets, attachments of QC plots, decisions logged without meetings.

Lightweight task management

So I can know which analyses unblock which experiments or grant sections.

Minimal context-switching

Fewer tools: integrate with Git, cloud storage, and notebooks.

What I hate

Being dragged into frequent status meetings that could have been an async note.

Tools that only understand wet-lab workflows and treat “analysis” as a single checkbox.

UIs with tiny tables and no keyboard shortcuts – click-heavy hell.

No clear mapping from “this analysis” → “which experiment and project?”

Notifications that interrupt deep work at random times.

What will make me use it

It respects my deep work blocks and prevents people from booking over them.

It gives me a clean view of what my work is unblocking (e.g. “If you finish this pipeline, X can design next experiment”).

Data & experiments feel like a single graph, not silos.

What will make me stop using it

If I feel forced to keep separate, hand-crafted tracking in Notion/Jira anyway.

If performance is slow with many records or attachments.

If it behaves like a rigid pipeline factory, not the exploratory, iterative analysis I actually do.

7. Emma Gallagher – Biotech Startup COO / Co-Founder

Role: Runs operations for a 15–20 person startup; half-lab, half-office

Chronotype: Morning-ish, but constantly context-switching

Style: Super Manager, but with high technical literacy

What I need most

Single pane of glass for operations

Project status, hiring needs, cash burn vs. planned experiments, equipment utilisation.

Simple reporting for investors & board

Weekly “what we did, what we learned, what’s next” pulled from actual lab activity.

Resource constraint visibility

Bottlenecks: “We’re blocked by only having 1 FACS machine + 2 trained users.”

Cross-team coordination

Biology, engineering, and data teams in one timeline.

Scalable structure

Won’t crumble when going from 10 → 40 people.

What I hate

Fragmented information – engineers in Jira, scientists in notebooks, operations in Asana.

Tools that are beautiful but shallow, can’t handle real lab complexity.

Needing a full-time “software admin” just to keep the system usable.

Systems that don’t export clean data for BI dashboards.

“All-or-nothing” adoption – I want partial rollout and progressive onboarding.

What will make me use it

I can walk into a board meeting with screenshots directly from the system and feel confident.

It reduces the number of fire-drills (“Why is the incubator double-booked again?”).

New staff get up to speed quicker, because expectations and protocols are visible.

What will make me stop using it

If the team repeatedly tells me it’s slowing them down or “just overhead.”

If the vendor/system can’t adapt as we change assays, direction, or org structure.

If I can’t easily pull out our data if we decide to migrate away.

8. Ciara Murphy – Clinical Research Nurse / Trial Coordinator

Role: Coordinates patient visits, sample collection, and lab handover

Chronotype: Early; sharp 7:00–12:00

Style: Manager/Hustler with patient-facing constraints

What I need most

Tight linking of clinic and lab schedules

Patient visit times → blood drawn → sample processed in lab within required windows.

Real-time status of lab readiness

Are the kits prepared? Is the centrifuge free? Who’s on duty to receive samples?

Patient-centric view of tasks

For each participant: what’s done, what’s due, what’s at risk.

Error minimization

Clear prompts for double-checking IDs, consent, time stamps.

Coordinated “quiet windows”

Times she can process documentation without being pulled back into the lab or clinic.

What I hate

Systems that are only lab-centric and ignore the reality of patient appointments.

Having to track critical things on paper sheets taped to fridges because software is clunky.

Tools that make it hard to see the day by patient, not by project.

Poor support for time-critical steps (e.g., must spin within X minutes of draw).

Inflexible systems that don’t handle rescheduled or missed appointments gracefully.

What will make me use it

It reduces missed windows (e.g., samples processed late) by nudging the right people at the right time.

Everyone (clinic + lab) sees the same truth about today’s schedule.

It makes audits easier because nothing is lost in email or paper.

What will make me stop using it

If it adds so much complexity that people revert to whiteboards and WhatsApp.

If it cannot cope with the chaos of real patients (late, sick, rescheduled).

If capturing data in it takes longer than doing my actual job.
