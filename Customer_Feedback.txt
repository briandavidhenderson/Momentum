Project Manager – Top 5 Hates

1. “Yet another system everyone refuses to use.”
If the software isn’t intuitive, half the team ignores it → chaos. A system is useless unless the whole lab buys in.

2. “Data lives everywhere except where it should.”
Bookings in one place, inventory in another, tasks in another, protocols in Dropbox… A new tool that adds one more silo is hated.

3. “Manual updates that feel like admin punishment.”
If I have to double-enter data or babysit people to update tasks, it becomes more work, not less.

4. “Terrible permissions and no role logic.”
Either everything is locked down like Fort Knox or everyone can edit everything. Both scenarios create disasters.

5. “Rigid workflows that don’t fit how real labs operate.”
Labs are messy. Projects pivot daily. If the software forces a rigid structure, it becomes unusable immediately.

Project Manager – Top 5 hates

No single source of truth
Having to open five different views or tools (tasks here, bookings there, inventory somewhere else) because the new software doesn’t actually centralise anything—just adds another layer.

Terrible onboarding for the team
No decent quick-start tours, templates, or examples. I don’t have time to train 18 people one by one because the UI is cryptic.

Rigid workflows that don’t match reality
The system forces a specific way to run projects that doesn’t fit how labs actually work (e.g. no support for experiments that span multiple projects, or shared equipment across groups).

Poor reporting / dashboards
I still have to export everything to Excel or PowerPoint just to answer basic questions like “Which projects are at risk?” or “Who’s overloaded this week?”

Permissions chaos
Either everything is locked down so tightly I become the bottleneck for every tiny change, or everything is wide open and I can’t stop people from editing critical stuff.

Bench Scientist – Top 5 Hates

1. “Slows me down when I’m at the bench.”
If updating the system takes longer than writing in my notebook or snapping a photo → hate instantly.

2. “Can’t find what I need quickly.”
Buried protocols, hidden equipment calendars, or 10-click flows = death. A scientist wants one tap → action.

3. “Mobile experience sucks.”
If I can’t easily run a protocol or book something from my phone while in the lab, it’s useless.

4. “Too many notifications or irrelevant alerts.”
Spam notifications make people disable the system → then they miss the important ones.

5. “Lack of integration with real lab life.”
If I can’t attach data files, photos, sample IDs, or link bookings → I stop using the tool and revert to paper/WhatsApp.

Bench Scientist – Top 5 hates

Too many clicks to do simple things
If booking an instrument or starting an experiment takes 10 clicks and 4 screens, I’ll go back to the whiteboard and paper sign-up sheet.

Slow, laggy, or buggy at the bench
The app hangs when I’m in the middle of a protocol, or doesn’t work properly on my phone/tablet with gloves on—instant hatred.

Can’t find anything
Poor search and organisation: I can’t quickly find the right protocol, previous experiment, or sample record, so I end up recreating work from scratch.

Data goes in but never comes back out usefully
I spend ages typing notes, uploading files, filling forms—and then it’s painful to actually view, compare, or reuse that information.

Feels like surveillance, not support
The tool is clearly built for management metrics, not for making my day easier—lots of mandatory fields and tracking, very little that helps me run better experiments.

Senior Scientist (Hands-on + Managerial) – Top 5 Hates

1. “Paperwork burden actually gets bigger.”
If risk assessments, SOPs, and approvals become harder, not easier → instant rejection.

2. “No high-level visibility.”
A system that hides workload distribution, training status, or experiment progress forces me to chase people.

3. “Approvals are buried or hard to sign off.”
If I have to hunt through menus or emails to approve RA/SOP/task updates → frustration skyrockets.

4. “Bad linking between safety, protocols, and equipment.”
If risks aren’t automatically tied to tasks, experiments, or equipment, I can’t trust the system.

5. “Not configurable for real-world exceptions.”
Labs change protocols hourly; rigid forms or forced fields break workflows and cause resistance.

Senior Scientist – Top 5 hates

Duplicated work between systems
I have to enter the same information in the ELN, in the safety system, and in the project tracker because they don’t talk to each other.

Approval bottlenecks with no flexibility
The system forces rigid approval flows (for SOPs, risk assessments, experiments), so everything waits on one person with no delegation or sensible overrides.

No overview tailored to my role
Either I get a granular mess of everyone’s tasks, or a useless high-level “100% on track” view—nothing that actually helps me manage people, safety, and science together.

Unclear audit and accountability
It’s hard to see who changed what and when (protocols, risks, data). When an issue arises, the system doesn’t help me reconstruct events clearly.

Constant context switching
I’m bouncing between tabs and modules (projects, safety, training, incidents, experiments) because the software is designed as separate silos, not around real workflows.
